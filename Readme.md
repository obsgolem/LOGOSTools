# Introduction
χαίρετε πάντες! This repo contains a transcription of the vocabulary sheets for _ΛΟΓΟΣ ΕΛΛΗΝΙΚΗ ΓΛΩΣΣΑ ΑΥΤΟΕΙΚΟΝΟΓΡΑΦΗΜΕΝΗ_ by Santiago Carbonell Martínez.

These were created by using OCR to extract the text from the book, then manually editing each sheet to correct OCR errors, particularly accent related ones. Mistakes in spelling or accents are either my fault or the OCR engine's fault, not that of the original author.

The following tasks are things I would consider useful for others, and would love help with.
* [x] Convert word lists into a machine friendly format, probably JSON.
* [x] Apply unicode normalization to NFD to both markdown and JSON formats.
* [ ] Add line number and word index information for the location of the word in the book.
* [ ] Macronize vocab list.

# Usage
To use the lists effectively, I recommend finding a tool that lets you perform diacritic insensitive searches. I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) with [Omnisearch](https://github.com/scambier/obsidian-omnisearch) to do this from my phone. Better would be if your tool also did fuzzy diacritic insensitive search of some sort. If you forget a word's meaning, look it up in the list to find the chapter to reference back to.

At the top of every file is the page numbers for the exercises of that chapter.

# Copyright & License
The copyright of the word lists remain with the original authors, and if they dislike my public reproduction of their lists then I am fully willing to take this repo down. All code and other novel material in this repository is licensed under the terms of the MIT license.
